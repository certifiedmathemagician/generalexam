							<h1>Advice From Previous Graduate Students</h1>
							<h2 style="color: #E94874;">What to wear, outline of process, formalities.</h2>
							<ul> 
								<li> For attire, you do not need to be overly formal (don't wear a suit). Do not be too casual either, dress nicely like you would to teach a class.  </li>
								<li> Be a few minutes early. After you are done with the exam (board presentation or paper presentation), the committee will immediately deliberate while you wait in the hall. You will find out within moments whether or not you passed. </li>
								<li> They will ask a question you do not know. That is part of the process. It is okay to say you do not know or ask for the question to be rephrased. </li>
							</ul>

							<h2 style="color: #E94874;"> How to prepare and study advice. </h2>
							<ul> 
								<li> <i> (Analysis Students) </i> Make a solid presentation so that questions will be minimal. If no stones are left unturned, you canâ€™t be stumped during your exam.  </li>
							</ul>

							
				
							
							<h2 style="color: #E94874;">Generic Advice</h2>
							<ul> 
								<li>  You are going to mess up often. That's okay. It's part of the learning process. Just keep working hard! </li>
								<li>  It is okay to have "wacky" ideas, try to share them with your advisor every now and then.  </li>
								<li>  Meet with your advisor every week if possible; it helps you stay on track and have a meeting to work towards. </li>
							</ul>
							
							<h2 style="color: #E94874;">Advice with Longevity</h2>
							<ul> 
								<li>  If you have an idea about the area that you will be working in, get an account on arxiv as soon as possible. You can then subscribe to areas of your interest and receive emails whenever new work in those areas gets published on arxiv. </li>
								<li>  TALK and have discussions with other people in your field, not just your advisor. </li>
							</ul>
