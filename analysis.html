							<h1>Analysis, Functional Analysis, Harmonic Analysis</h1>
							<h2 style="color: #4BB983;">Reccommended Texts or Study Materials </h2>
							<p> Topological Vector Spaces <br /> 
							Distributions and Kernels: Pure and Applied Mathematics by Fran√ßois Treves <br /> 
							A Course on Topological Vector Spaces by Jurgen Voigt <br /> 
							The Integrals of Lebesgue, Denjoy, Perron, and Henstock by Russell A. Gordon.  </p>
							
							<h2 style="color: #4BB983;">Foundational Tools/Techniques/Ideas: </h2>
							<p> Sequences and Series in different topological vector spaces (TVS) <br /> 
							Distributions (ones in Functional analysis like Dirac delta function and not the probability kind) <br /> 
							One idea is to observe results true in finite-dimensional TVS and then prove whether they hold for a special class of infinite-dimensional TVS. Another is to use distributional integration instead of the usual Riemann/Lebesgue definition.  </p>
							
							
							<h2 style="color: #4BB983;"> Common Advisors and Committee Members </h2>
							<p> Dr. Ricardo Estrada (advisor), Dr. Shipman, Dr. Sundar </p>
							
							<h2 style="color: #4BB983;">Analysis students give presentations, below are quotes from graduate students about that process.</h2>
							<h6 style="color: #2B7654;"> Question: Did you present a paper or an idea? </h6>
							<p> "I presented a survey for the most part; followed with results, few as they may be, that we had obtained. The idea was to present stuff that would help me better prepare for research." </p>
							
							<h6 style="color: #2B7654;"> Question: What was the process for selecting your presentation material? </h6>
						    <p> "We found an area that both I and my advisor liked that we had questions about. We decided to study some papers in the vein of those questions. This gave us a good idea of what was known and what could be proven but hadn't yet been. My presentation was essentially a neat summary of the work done so far in answering those questions and then some results that we had managed to prove based on the work we had read." </p>
