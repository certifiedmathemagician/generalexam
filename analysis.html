							<h1>Functional Analysis, Harmonic Analysis/Fourier Analysis</h1>

							<h2 style="color: #4BB983;">Recommended Texts or Study Materials </h2>
							<h4 style="color: #2C7250;"> Functional Analysis </h4>
							<ul> 
								<!-- <li> Topological Vector Spaces </li> -->
								<li> W Rudin: Real and Complex Analysis <i> Dr. Shipman says, "This is an excellent classic with a breadth of basics on measure and integration, abstract function spaces, functional analysis, and complex variables."</i> </li>
								<li> B V Limaye:  Functional Analysis </li>
								<li> Topological Vector Spaces, Distributions and Kernels, François Treves. </li>
								<li> A Course on Topological Vector Spaces, Jurgen Voigt. </li>
					
							</ul>

							<h4 style="color: #2C7250;"> Harmonic Analysis </h4>
							<ul> 
								<li> E Stein: Singular Integrals and Differentiability Properties of Functions </li>
								<li> G Folland: A Course in Abstract Harmonic Analysis </li>
							
							</ul>
							
							<h2 style="color: #4BB983;">Foundational Tools/Techniques/Ideas: </h2>

							<h4 style="color: #2C7250;"> Topics </h4>
							<ul> 
								<li> Distribution theory </li>
								<li> The open mapping theorem, closed graph theorem, and uniform boundedness theorem are fundamental to all areas of analysis; they occur repeatedly in abstract analysis. </li>
								<li> Fourier analysis </li> 
								<li> Sequences and Series in different topological vector spaces (TVS) <i> Note: this is a bit of a specialized area and not required of every analysis student. </i> </li>
							
							</ul>

							<h4 style="color: #2C7250;"> Ideas </h4>
							<ul> 
								<li> Harmonic analysis and Fourier analysis are intimately related, often being considered to be the same subject. </li>
								<li> Abstract harmonic analysis is based on characters of group actions; when those groups become non-commutative, characters are replaced by more general representation theory. </li>
								<li> Observe results true in finite-dimensional TVS and then prove whether they hold for a special class of infinite-dimensional TVS. </li>
								<li> Use distributional integration instead of the usual Riemann/Lebesgue definition. </li>
							</ul>

							<h2 style="color: #4BB983;">Analysis students give presentations, below are quotes from graduate students about that process.</h2>
							<h6 style="color: #2C7250;"> Question: Did you present a paper or an idea? </h6>
							<ul>
								<li> "I presented a survey for the most part; followed with results, few as they may be, that we had obtained. 
									The idea was to present stuff that would help me better prepare for research." </li>

							</ul>
							
							<h6 style="color: #2C7250;"> Question: What was the process for selecting your presentation material? </h6>
							<ul>
								<li> "We found an area that both I and my advisor 	d that we had questions about. 
									We decided to study some papers in the vein of those questions. This gave us a good idea of what was known and what could be proven but hadn't yet been. 
									My presentation was essentially a neat summary of the work done so far in answering those questions and then some results that we had managed to prove based on the work we had read."
